*Recycling-Games* is a Unity project that features two distinct, engaging games aimed at teaching players about recycling and waste management.

* Recycle Dash: An *endless runner* where players collect trash items while navigating through obstacles. And after collecting a certain number of items the player has to sort the items.
* Recycle Rush: A *drag-and-drop sorting game* where players must sort the items into the correct recycling bins.

This project combines fun gameplay with educational content to promote environmental awareness.

## ‚òÅ PlayFab Integration

Both games use *PlayFab* for storing player scores and managing leaderboards.

### 1. Create a PlayFab Account

* Go to the [PlayFab website](https://playfab.com/) and sign up for an account.

### 2. Create New Titles

* Within your PlayFab account, create two separate titles (games) for each game:
    * Recycle Dash (for the runner game)
    * Recycle Rush (for the sorting game)

### 3. Create Leaderboards

* For each title, create a *Legacy Leaderboard* table.
* The leaderboard must be named **High_Score** to work with the default code. If you wish to change the name, you must also update the StatisticName field in the ScoreManager.cs script.

### 4. Configure Unity

* In Unity, navigate to Assets/PlayFabSDK/Shared/Public/Resources.
* Click on **PlayFabSharedSettings**.
* Enter the correct Title IDs for each game:
    * Recycle Dash ‚Üí Dash Title ID
    * Recycle Rush ‚Üí Rush Title ID

### 5. Verify Integration

* Test the game in Unity to ensure scores are correctly being saved to and retrieved from PlayFab.
